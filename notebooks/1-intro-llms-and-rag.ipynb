      "Certainly! 42Berlin is a coding school that follows the innovative educational model pioneered by 42, a coding school founded in Paris by Xavier Niel, Florian Bucher, Nicolas Sadirac, and Kwame Yamgnane. The school is designed to provide a unique and intensive learning experience for aspiring software developers. Here are some key aspects of 42Berlin:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Educational Model\n",
      "1. **Peer-to-Peer Learning**: 42Berlin emphasizes peer-to-peer learning, where students help each other solve problems and learn new concepts. This collaborative approach is believed to enhance both technical skills and soft skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Project-Based Learning**: The curriculum is heavily project-based. Students work on a series of projects that increase in complexity, allowing them to apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **No Teachers or Classes**: Unlike traditional schools, 42Berlin does not have teachers or formal classes. Instead, students learn through a combination of self-study, peer collaboration, and online resources.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Admission Process\n",
      "1. **Piscine (Pool)**: The admission process begins with a four-week intensive bootcamp called the \"Piscine.\" During this period, applicants are immersed in a rigorous coding environment to assess their problem-solving skills, motivation, and ability to adapt.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Selection**: After the Piscine, the top performers are selected to join the full program.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Curriculum\n",
      "1. **Core Program**: The core program typically lasts around 3 to 5 years, depending on the student's pace. It covers a wide range of topics including algorithms, data structures, web development, mobile development, and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Specializations**: As students progress, they can choose to specialize in areas like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, or other advanced topics.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Community and Culture\n",
      "1. **24/7 Access**: The school is open 24/7, allowing students to work at their own pace and on their own schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Diverse Community**: 42Berlin attracts a diverse group of students from various backgrounds, fostering a rich and dynamic learning environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Outcomes\n",
      "1. **Job Placement**: The school has a strong focus on preparing students for the job market. Many graduates go on to work for top tech companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Networking**: The school's alumni network and industry partnerships provide valuable opportunities for networking and career advancement.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Location\n",
      "42Berlin is located in the heart of Berlin, Germany, a city known for its vibrant tech scene and startup culture.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cost\n",
      "1. **Tuition-Free**: One of the most appealing aspects of 42Berlin is that it is tuition-free. The school is funded through partnerships with companies and other sponsors.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "42Berlin offers a unique and challenging educational experience for those interested in a career in software development. Its focus on peer-to-peer learning, project-based curriculum, and 24/7 access make it an attractive option for motivated and self-driven individuals.\n"

    "If you want to make your prompting even more advanced, you can look into Prompt Engineering best practices. Prompt Engineering is the process of designing and refining LLM prompts. It involves crafting questions, instructions, or statements that guide the model to produce desired outputs. Effective prompt engineering can significantly enhance the quality, relevance, and accuracy of the responses generated by the model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Best practices change over time and are somewhat different depending on the LLM type, but general guidelines are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clarity and Specificity: Clearly state what you want the model to do. Avoid ambiguous language.\n",
    "* Context and Detail: Provide sufficient context to guide the model.\n",
    "* Iterative Refinement: Experiment with different phrasings and structures to see what works best.\n",
    "* Constraints and Instructions: Specify any constraints or formats you want the response to follow.\n",
    "* Examples and Templates: Use examples to show the model what kind of response you expect.\n",
    "* Step-by-Step Reasoning: Instead of providing a direct answer, aske the model to explain its thought process step-by-step. \n",
    "* Breaking Down Complex Tasks: For tasks that require multiple stages of reasoning or involve complex information, breaking them down into smaller, separated steps can lead to better results.\n",
